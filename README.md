# HW #2d Let's try out some UIViewController view life cycle methods

In the starter project, there are existing methods that are implemented including creating some views, start animations, add titles etc. You will be focus on leveraging the existing methods and apply them at the right time for the life cycle events. 

## Getting Started
* The goal of this exercise is to strengthen your understanding of the view life cycles and when/how to manage the views. 

## Print out all the life cycle events 
* Override life cycle events to print out the event when they are called in the view controller. 


### Initialize some views 
* set title for navigation bar 
* initialize pikachuCount number to be 3
* create the button that handles user tap 
* create PikachuCount label 

### Hide root view 
* hide the root view before it shows up on the screen 

### Add some animation 
* animate the root view to show 2s after the root view has been loaded 
* animate the last row of Pikachu
